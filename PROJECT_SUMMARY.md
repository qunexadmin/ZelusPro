# 📊 Zelus Pro - Project Summary

## What We Built

**Zelus Pro** is a complete business management mobile app for beauty professionals (stylists and salon owners). It was built alongside the existing Zelus consumer app by extracting shared code into reusable packages.

- Created **zelus_ui** package with design system and reusable widgets
- Both consumer and Pro apps can now use these packages

### ✅ 2. Mobile Pro App
- Complete Flutter app with **9 feature modules**
- **14+ screens** covering all business needs
- Clean architecture with Riverpod state management
- Professional Material Design 3 UI

### ✅ 3. Backend Integration
- Added **pro_dashboard** router with 20+ endpoints
- Integrated with existing FastAPI backend
- Mock data implementation ready for DB connection

- ✅ **Feature-based folder structure** improves maintainability
- ✅ **Mock data first** allows UI development without backend
- ✅ **Shared design system** ensures consistency

### Best Practices Applied
- Separation of concerns (data/UI/logic)
- Provider pattern for dependency injection
- Freezed for immutable data models
- Extension methods for cleaner code
- Constants for configuration

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Password validation
- Input sanitization
- Token-based auth structure

### To Implement
- JWT token refresh
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- Data encryption at rest
